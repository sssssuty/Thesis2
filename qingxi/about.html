        <strong>清晰 is a website for all Chinese language learners, no matter what experience level, emphasizing on the sub-systems and rules within the larger language system.</strong><br><br>
        From the designer and constructor:<br>
        Hi there, welcome to 清晰. I am the designer, Tingyu Su. This is the main part of my Thesis II for BFA Communication Design at Parsons School of Design, in 2020.<br><br>
        Before I landed on this concept, I look back at my Thesis I projects. I explored the tension between in-control and out-of-control through book design, 3D motion graphics, typeface design, and interaction design with Java. I came to the point that I want to make something functional, a digital platform that can push alive to face the general public; educational, where people can learn something; typographical, since I am a huge type lover; and something special, not in style but in how I am presenting my content.<br><br>
        I also asked myself some other questions to decide the content, or just to understand myself a little better.<br><br>
        For example, what do I care? What do I want to learn more? How can I contribute to the world as a designer or as the 100% me? What skills do I have and want to learn?<br><br>
        I found the answer. I would love to explore the intersection of Mandarin Simplified Chinese language system, web interaction design, and archiving as my focus. I would like to work on editorial and art direction on the side.
